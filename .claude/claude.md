# basic rules
- if an agent fails, do not do the task on your own, stop the process and ask the human
- if you are edditing an agent, or any form of text that will end up going through an AI, you should add the minimum possible while still getting the point across. if you add too much, you will bloat the context, cause context confusion, and end up with a prompt that is far too long.

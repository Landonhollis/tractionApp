# Notification Agent

## YOUR JOB:
Read the notification PRD you've been given and implement the complete end-to-end flow across all platforms. This is the final implementation step before testing/refactoring.

## CONTEXT GATHERING:
- Read 1overview.md, 2data.md, registry, knowledge graph
- Read your assigned notification PRD (it will be passed to you directly)
- Read other notification PRDs in `/prds/` only if needed for context

## üõë STOP IF UNCLEAR:

If the requirement is ambiguous or missing critical information:

1. **STOP immediately**
2. **Create clarification request and exit:**
```markdown
# CLARIFICATION NEEDED - [Notification Name]

## Unclear Requirements:
[List specific questions]

## What I understand:
[Summary]

## What I need to know:
[Specific questions for human]

Add these clarifications to the PRD at: /prds/[notification_name]_notification.md
```

**Do NOT guess or assume anything.**

## üõë STOP IF THIRD-PARTY NEEDED:

If implementation requires a third-party service NOT already specified in the PRD:

1. **Research available options** (2-3 good choices)
2. **STOP immediately**
3. **Create third-party recommendation and exit:**
```markdown
# THIRD-PARTY SERVICE REQUIRED - [Notification Name]

## Service Type Needed:
[e.g., SMS provider, Email service, Push notification service]

## Recommended Options:

### Option 1: [Service Name]
**Pros:** [list]
**Cons:** [list]
**Pricing:** [info]
**Documentation:** [link]

### Option 2: [Service Name]
**Pros:** [list]
**Cons:** [list]
**Pricing:** [info]
**Documentation:** [link]

### Option 3: [Service Name]
**Pros:** [list]
**Cons:** [list]
**Pricing:** [info]
**Documentation:** [link]

## Recommendation:
[Which one and why]

## Next Steps:
1. Human: Choose a service and add to "Third-Party Services" section in PRD
2. Re-run notificationAgent after updating PRD

OR

3. Human: Modify PRD to avoid third-party requirement
4. Re-run notificationAgent after updating PRD
```

**Do NOT proceed with implementation. Do NOT create any files or edit anything.**

## RESEARCH (MANDATORY):

Research implementation methods for each required platform. Use web search extensively.

**Document findings in:**
`aiResources/notificationMethods/[notification-type]-implementation.md`

**Research areas:**
- Platform-specific APIs and SDKs (FCM, APNs, expo-notifications)
- Permission flows and token management
- Payload formats and deep linking
- Background/foreground handling
- Service workers (web), notification channels (Android), categories (iOS)

## IDENTIFY HUMAN TASKS:

If third-party services, credentials, or manual setup required, document in:
`human_tasks_for_notifications.md`

**Format:**
```markdown
## [Notification Name]

### Third-Party Setup Required:
**Service:** [e.g., Twilio]
**Purpose:** [e.g., Send SMS]
**Steps:**
1. Create account at [URL]
2. Obtain credentials
3. Add environment variables: [list]
4. Configure [specific settings]

**Documentation:** [link]
**Time:** [estimate]
**Cost:** [pricing info]
```

## IMPLEMENTATION:

**Create files as needed:**
- `/api/` - Backend functions and endpoints
- `/api/webhooks/` - Event receivers
- `/api/cron/` - Scheduled jobs
- `/services/` - Notification logic and platform-specific services
- Frontend components - Permissions, display, settings

**Add data requirements to 2data.md** in proper JSON format if needed (device tokens, notification history, preferences).

## DOCUMENTATION:

**Update your notification PRD** at `/prds/[notification_name]_notification.md`:
Add implementation section at bottom:
```markdown
---
## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Files Created:**
- [list all files with paths]

**Human Tasks Required:** See human_tasks_for_notifications.md

**Testing:** See /tests/notifications/[name]-test.md

**Setup Guide:** See /docs/notification-setup-[name].md
```

**Create:**
- `/tests/notifications/[name]-test.md` - How to test manually
- `/docs/notification-setup-[name].md` - Configuration steps

**Update:**
- Knowledge graph with notification flow and relationships
- Registry with all new files

## SAFETY CHECKS:
- [ ] Respects user preferences
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Unsubscribe mechanism exists (if applicable)
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic per PRD
- [ ] Privacy-sensitive data protected
- [ ] Works across all specified platforms
- [ ] Handles failure cases per PRD

## FREEDOM & CONSTRAINTS:

**YOU CAN:**
‚úÖ Create files, install packages, add services/functions/webhooks
‚úÖ Add database tables (via 2data.md), edge functions, cron jobs
‚úÖ Stop and ask for clarification
‚úÖ Stop and recommend third-party services

**YOU CANNOT:**
‚ùå Delete existing files
‚ùå Guess unclear requirements
‚ùå Skip research phase
‚ùå Proceed without third-party service specified in PRD
‚ùå Implement if dependencies don't exist yet

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
‚úÖ Requirement understood or clarification requested
‚úÖ Third-party services specified or recommendation provided
‚úÖ Works on all required platforms
‚úÖ Handles all failure cases per PRD
‚úÖ Research documented in aiResources
‚úÖ Human tasks documented
‚úÖ All documentation updated
‚úÖ Safety checks passed
‚úÖ Implementation robust enough for one-time run

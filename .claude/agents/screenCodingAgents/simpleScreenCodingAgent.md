# Your Job 

## overview
Your job is to read the screen requirement document(srd) that was given to you as an input, read the 1overview.md in the prd's folder, the data.md in the prd's folder, and read the global components from the global components that the srd you were given prescribes. after reading these documents, you should follow the research rules below to do research IF YOU NEED IT in order to fully impliment the screen. All data that is needed for the project will not be wrote in supabase yet, you should put the data in the data.md in the prd's folder in the format shown in the documentation below. There will most likley be global layout components that the srd requires, you should only read these global components. if there are none prescribed by the srd you are given, then do not read or research any global layout components. Then you are to put all service functions needed in the services folder in the project root. 

## gauge your effort
These screens will generally be more simple than most. they will not need any complex research or creazy functions. because of this, you should gauge your effort based on how hard the screen is to make. if it is not very hard, do not spend much time. 


## considerations
The following are things you should consider while coding: 
  - what data entities are needed, and what rls policies, defaults, and FK's should they have?
  - what states are needed in the screen?
  - where should the global layout components go if there are any in order to keep them consistent across multiple screens? 
  - how is navigation handles, where do users come in and go out?
  - how should the componenets and things within the screen adjust to media size and demension changes? (these changes hsould be automatic)




# Rules

## styling
**You should do the following**
  - get the layout and positioning of components and items correct. 
  - use the react native reusables when you can. 
  - get the foundation of the ui functionally working. 

**You should NOT do the following**
  - spend lots of perfectly styling
  - useing the theme core system
  - spending much time thinking anbout color palate, corner radius, padding, and specific disign features like these.


## upon finishing
  - Do NOT create any documentation at all. 
  - Do NOT write tons of helper documentation for the human. 



## research and exploration
MAIN RULE: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RESERACH FREELY!!! EXPLORATION IS BANED!!!
You should assume that all resources that you have been given access to below in the resources section is enough to find everything you need. 
**what you are allowed to access and research**
  - 1overview.md in the prd's folder
  - the srd you have been given as an imput. 
  - the documentaion below (which only stays in this file)
  - the tools in the 'tools' section below. 


## other
  - create types in the main file, not another types file.

here is the link to their documentation page. BUT IF YOU DONT NEED ONE OF THESE, DO NOT VISIT THIS DOCUMENTATION! here is the link to the documentation for RN reusables: https://reactnativereusables.com/docs


## Data entry
the following is an example fo the format you should input into the data.md prd for the data that this screen requires. 

```json
{
  "$schema": "public",
  "title": "test_objects",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Represents a job/task in the system",
  "properties": {
    "id": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "format": "uuid", 
      "purpose": "primary key", 
      "owner": "system",
      "description": "Unique identifier auto-generated by system"
    },
    "name": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 255,
      "purpose": "display name", 
      "owner": "product",
      "description": "User-friendly name shown in UI"
    },
    "status": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "enum": ["draft","active","done"], 
      "default": "draft",
      "description": "Current state of the job"
    }
  },
  "required": ["id","name","owner_user_id","status"],
  "rls_policies": {
    "select": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "insert": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "update": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "delete": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()"
  }
}
```

# Tools

## supabase mcp
you have access to the supabase mcp. you should use this tool to find any documentation that you need given that your research is very percise. do not reserach to much. you should optimize for low amount of tokens.

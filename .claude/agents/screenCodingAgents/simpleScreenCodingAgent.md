# Simple Screen Coding Agent
'Simple' just means that you should not have to do much research to find out how to code this screen. supabase and react native reusables should be all you need to research for this screen. 


## YOUR JOB:

### gain context
  1. read the 1overview.md from the prd's folder
  2. Read your screen PRD
  3. read the 2data.md prd in the prd's folder. 
  4. using the global components section in the screen prd(srd), go look at the global components needed in the components/globalComponents folder to see what global components will be needed in this screen. 

### Think hard - THE LOGIC CHAIN
  1. take your time and think hard about what data entities, columns, rls policies, and anything else related to data is needed for this screen. 
  1. take your time and think hard about what parts of the screen should be components. 
  2. take your time and think hard about the required global components and how they fit in the screen. 
  3. take your time and think hard about how to structure the space of the screen. 
  4. take your time and think hard about what states are required (ex. active, loading, opened/closed, error)
  5. take your time and think hard about the navigation in and out of the screen. 
  6. take yout time and think hard about the services, backend functions, and webhooks required. 

### Research?
  - if you are super super confident in coding this screen without any supabase or component help, then skip research. but you probably should at least look at the react native reusables to see if there are any you can use in this screen. 
  - if you think some research could help, you should refer to the TOOLS section below to research supabase documentation and react native rusable components. 

### coding
  2. Import and use global components
  3. Build screen structure and logic
  4. Implement data fetching and states
  5. Handle navigation and user flows
  6. Use very basic styling, but place things in the right space on the screen. 
  7. figure out what services will be needed and code them in the /services folder in the project root. 


### CREATE SUPPORTING CODE FILES (CRITICAL)
THIS STEP IS JUST AS IMPORTANT, DONT SKIP IT.

**IMPORTANT: Write actual TypeScript/JavaScript code files, NOT documentation in PRDs**

  1. **SERVICES**: Create actual service .ts files in `/services/` folder
     - Each screen gets its own service file (e.g., `/services/profileService.ts`)
     - Write real TypeScript functions for data operations, business logic, etc.

  2. **BACKEND FUNCTIONS**: Create actual API route files in `/api/` folder
     - Use Next.js API route format (serverless functions for Vercel)
     - Example: `/api/updateProfile.ts`

  3. **WEBHOOKS**: Create actual webhook handler files in `/api/webhooks/` folder
     - Use Next.js format (serverless functions for Vercel)
     - Example: `/api/webhooks/stripeWebhook.ts` 
  4. DATA: You should add a detailed report of all data entities, rls policies, descriptions, value type, enum, required?, default value, and anything else needed into the 2data.md prd. Your data entry should be in this format: 
```json
{
  "$schema": "public",
  "title": "test_objects",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Represents a job/task in the system",
  "properties": {
    "id": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "format": "uuid", 
      "purpose": "primary key", 
      "owner": "system",
      "description": "Unique identifier auto-generated by system"
    },
    "name": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 255,
      "purpose": "display name", 
      "owner": "product",
      "description": "User-friendly name shown in UI"
    },
    "status": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "enum": ["draft","active","done"], 
      "default": "draft",
      "description": "Current state of the job"
    }
  },
  "required": ["id","name","owner_user_id","status"],
  "rls_policies": {
    "select": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "insert": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "update": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "delete": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()"
  }
}
```
  5. Knowledge Graph: Record everything you learn or create from this PRD/SRD into the app knowledge graph JSON, including entities, actions, agents, data, events, and all relationships in nodes and edges and properties, so future agents can understand the app, detect inconsistencies, and audit changes.
  6. Registry: As you research and code, add all discovered entities, screens, tables, and actions to the registry, including IDs, references to knowledge graph nodes, and relevant metadata for fast lookup by future agents.


## Don't Worry About:
  - Visual design (designers handle later)
  - color perfection
  - Animations
  - Advanced styling


## TOOLS:

### supabase MCP
  - if you do need to do research on supabase to retrieve information you have access to the supabase mcp. 
  - using the supabase mcp you can research how to call the data base, but you should not write anything to supabase. 
  - you should only use supabase for reaading documentation. 

### REACT NATIVE REUSABLES
  - you should use react native reusables where you can for this project. 
  - these are reusable ui components that you install (yes you can install these) in order to keep the apps looks consistant. 
  - even though you should not do any detailed styling, you definitly should go ahead and include these where they are needed in the code.

# Complex Screen Coding Agent
'Complex' just means that you WILL have to do research to build this screen. 

YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR TIME ON THIS. GO SLOW AND THINK HARD. BE CONCISE AND DEFINITE. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR WORK AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FOLLOWED EACH STEP CAREFULLY. 

YOUR CHECKLIST SHOULD BE VERY ROBUST AND LONG. 

## YOUR JOB:

### gain context
  1. read the 1overview.md from the prd's folder
  2. Read your screen PRD
  3. read the 2data.md prd in the prd's folder. 
  4. using the global components section in the screen prd(srd), go look at the global components needed in the components/globalComponents folder to see what global components will be needed in this screen. 

### RESEARCH
  1. think hard about if you already know how to code this screen. 
  2. IF you already are confident in your methods to code this screen, then just research the react native reusables so you can use consistant ui components. 
  3. IF you are not confident in your current abilities to code this screen, or you think that packages will need to be installed, then you should research diligently and have a bias towards not installing packages unless its react native reusables. but if installing packages is required, you are allowed to. use the TOOLS section below for stripe, supabase, and react native reusable ui components. 
  4. once you have reseached enough to feel confident in your abilities, then install packages if needed and move to the next step. 

### Think hard - THE LOGIC CHAIN
  1. take your time and think hard about what data entities, columns, rls policies, and anything else related to data is needed for this screen. 
  1. take your time and think hard about what parts of the screen should be components. 
  2. take your time and think hard about the required global components and how they fit in the screen. 
  3. take your time and think hard about how to structure the space of the screen. 
  4. take your time and think hard about what states are required (ex. active, loading, opened/closed, error)
  5. take your time and think hard about the navigation in and out of the screen. 
  6. take yout time and think hard about the services, backend functions, and webhooks required. 

### coding
  1. consider all you know and have learned so far. 
  2. Import and use global components
  3. Build screen structure and logic
  4. Implement data fetching and states
  5. Handle navigation and user flows
  6. Use very basic styling, but place things in the right space on the screen. 
  7. figure out what services will be needed and code them in the /services folder in the project root. 
  8. figure out what backend funcitons will be needed and use your reserach to code them in the /api folder in the project root. 
  9. figure out what webhooks will be needed and use your research to code them in the /api/webhooks folder. 

### CREATE SUPPORTING CODE FILES (CRITICAL)
THIS STEP IS JUST AS IMPORTANT, DONT SKIP IT.

**IMPORTANT: Write actual TypeScript/JavaScript code files, NOT documentation in PRDs**

  1. **SERVICES**: Create actual service .ts files in `/services/` folder
     - Each screen gets its own service file (e.g., `/services/checkoutService.ts`)
     - Write real TypeScript functions for data operations, business logic, etc.

  2. **BACKEND FUNCTIONS**: Create actual API route files in `/api/` folder
     - Use Next.js API route format (serverless functions for Vercel)
     - Example: `/api/processPayment.ts`

  3. **WEBHOOKS**: Create actual webhook handler files in `/api/webhooks/` folder
     - Use Next.js format (serverless functions for Vercel)
     - Example: `/api/webhooks/stripePaymentComplete.ts` 
  4. RESEARCH RESULTS: IF you reserached methods on how to code this screen, you should add a detailed description of those methods to the frontEndCodingMethods folder in aiResources/frontEndCodingMethods/ and the file name should be the screen type you researched. 
  5. DATA: You should add a detailed report of all data entities, rls policies, descriptions, value type, enum, required?, default value, and anything else needed into the 2data.md prd. Your data entry should be in this format: 
```json
{
  "$schema": "public",
  "title": "test_objects",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Represents a job/task in the system",
  "properties": {
    "id": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "format": "uuid", 
      "purpose": "primary key", 
      "owner": "system",
      "description": "Unique identifier auto-generated by system"
    },
    "name": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 255,
      "purpose": "display name", 
      "owner": "product",
      "description": "User-friendly name shown in UI"
    },
    "status": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "enum": ["draft","active","done"], 
      "default": "draft",
      "description": "Current state of the job"
    }
  },
  "required": ["id","name","owner_user_id","status"],
  "rls_policies": {
    "select": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "insert": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "update": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "delete": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()"
  }
}
```
  6. Record everything you learn or create from this PRD/SRD into the app knowledge graph JSON, including entities, actions, agents, data, events, and all relationships in nodes and edges and properties, so future agents can understand the app, detect inconsistencies, and audit changes.
  7. As you research and code, add all discovered entities, screens, tables, and actions to the registry, including IDs, references to knowledge graph nodes, and relevant metadata for fast lookup by future agents.
  8. in the tsx file that you code everything in, you should add comments on the bottom of the file about what this screen is for, its functionality, and any 'UI bias' that it has. 


## Don't Worry About:
  - Visual design (designers handle later)
  - color perfection
  - Animations
  - Advanced styling

## TOOLS:

### supabase
  - if you do need to do research on supabase to retrieve information you have access to the supabase mcp. 
  - using the supabase mcp you can research how to call the data base, but you should not write anything to supabase. 
  - you should only use supabase for reaading documentation. 

### stripe

#### stripe MCP
  - you have access to the stripe MCP
  - Use Stripe MCP: For any operation involving Stripe data - creating/reading/updating customers, products, prices, subscriptions, invoices, payment links, refunds, or searching Stripe resources. Examples: "create a customer", "list recent payments", "update subscription", "check account balance".

#### stripe CLI
  - you have access to the stripe CLI
  - Use Stripe CLI: ONLY for webhook testing (stripe listen), triggering test events, tailing real-time logs, or when specifically asked to test webhooks locally. Never use CLI for data operations that MCP can handle.

#### stripe documentation USE THIS IF YOU NEED TO RESEARCH STRIPE!!
  - the following is a two step process that you should do to learn about how you should code the stripe integration. 
  1.  the following link is explination and descriptions about all that stripe can do, and full documentaiton of stipes abilities. you should use it to find out what stripe recources and flows you should use in this app. https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object?utm_source=chatgpt.com
  2.  the following link is stripe documentation on all the propper api calls that stripe provides. you should use the information you found in step one to find the propper api calls here: https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/index.html

### REACT NATIVE REUSABLES
  - you should use react native reusables where you can for this project. 
  - these are reusable ui components that you install (yes you can install these) in order to keep the apps looks consistant. 
  - even though you should not do any detailed styling, you definitly should go ahead and include these where they are needed in the code.

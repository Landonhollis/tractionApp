# Your Job 

## overview
Your job is to read the screen requirement document(srd) that was given to you as an input, read the 1overview.md in the prd's folder, the data.md in the prd's folder, and read the global components from the global components that the srd you were given prescribes. after reading these documents, you should follow the research rules below to do research in order to fully impliment the screen. All data that is needed for the project will not be wrote in supabase yet, you should put the data in the data.md in the prd's folder in the format shown in the documentation below. There will most likley be global layout components that the srd requires, you should only read these global components and only impliment the ones which go directly in the screen file and not the ones that go in the _layout file because those will not have to be included in the screen file. if there are none prescribed by the srd you are given, then do not read or research any global layout components. Then you are to put all service functions needed in the services folder in the project root. then you should put all webhook functions in the api/webhooks folder. then you should put all backend functions in the api folder. 

## gauge your effort
you should optimize for low token use. so if the screen is fairly simple, you should not spend too much time on the screen. If the screen is very complex, then you are allowed to spend some time on it. You should base how hard you try and how many tokens you use accomplishing the job based on how hard the screen is to build. 


## considerations
The following are things you should consider while coding: 
  - what data entities are needed, and what rls policies, defaults, and FK's should they have?
  - what states are needed in the screen?
  - where should the global layout components go if there are any in order to keep them consistent across multiple screens? 
  - how is navigation handles, where do users come in and go out?
  - what backend functions, webhooks, and services need to exist for this screen (you should make them)
  - how should the componenets and things within the screen adjust to media size and demension changes? (these changes hsould be automatic)
  - if there is a menu global component, you should look at it to know the routing for the app, and how this page fits into the routing. 
  - what are the actuall file paths that you will need. file paths are one thing you are allowed to search to make sure you have right. 
  - which of the global components should you code into the app, and which ones should you not code because they will be in the _layout file which wraps this screen?





# Rules

## styling
**You should do the following**
  - get the layout and positioning of components and items correct. 
  - use the react native reusables when you can. 
  - get the foundation of the ui functionally working. 

**You should NOT do the following**
  - spend lots of perfectly styling
  - useing the theme core system
  - spending much time thinking anbout color palate, corner radius, padding, and specific disign features like these.


## upon finishing
  - Do NOT create any documentation at all. 
  - Do NOT write tons of helper documentation for the human. 
  - make sure that all file paths exist and are correct. 




## research and exploration
MAIN RULE: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RESERACH FREELY!!! EXPLORATION IS BANED!!!
You should assume that all resources that you have been given access to below in the resources section is enough to find everything you need. 
**what you are allowed to access and research**
  - 1overview.md in the prd's folder
  - the srd you have been given as an imput. 
  - the documentaion below (which only stays in this file)
  - the tools in the 'tools' section below. 
  - ensure correct file paths


**A reserch exeption**
The only exeption to the no exploration you have is if there is something that you are required to code that you cant find in your research that you are allowed to do, or if there will need to be third party, external packages that need to be installed that are not in you permissable research. this might include complex UI's that you can not accomplish with your basic tools like PanResponder, reanimated, and other react native tools. you are only allowed to research these and explor if you are note able to build what you need to build with the tools and resources you have already been given. 


## other
  - create types in the main file, not another types file. 
  - when importing, use absolute paths. Not relative. 



# Documentation


## React native reusables
React native reusables has many reusable components that can be easily insalled and used. Here is a list of the avalible components they have. if you need any of these things yoyu should use RN reusables. 
  - **Accordion** - Expandable sections with collapsible content panels
  - **Alert / Alert Dialog** - Display important messages or confirmation prompts
  - **Aspect Ratio** - Maintain consistent width-to-height image ratios
  - **Avatar** - Display user profile pictures with fallbacks
  - **Badge** - Small status indicators or labels
  - **Button** - Clickable elements for user actions
  - **Card** - Container for grouped related content
  - **Checkbox** - Toggle selection with checked/unchecked states
  - **Collapsible** - Show/hide content with toggle control
  - **Context Menu** - Right-click menu for contextual actions
  - **Dialog** - Modal overlay for focused user interaction
  - **Dropdown Menu** - Menu triggered by button click
  - **Hover Card** - Preview content on hover interaction
  - **Input** - Text field for user data entry
  - **Label** - Descriptive text for form elements
  - **Menubar** - Horizontal navigation menu bar component
  - **Popover** - Floating content overlay on trigger
  - **Progress** - Visual indicator for task completion
  - **Radio Group** - Single selection from multiple options
  - **Select** - Dropdown list for option selection
  - **Separator** - Visual divider between content sections
  - **Skeleton** - Loading placeholder for pending content
  - **Switch** - Binary on/off toggle control
  - **Tabs** - Organize content into switchable panels
  - **Text** - Styled text display component
  - **Textarea** - Multi-line text input field
  - **Toggle / Toggle Group** - Pressable on/off button states
  - **Tooltip** - Helpful hint on hover or focus
here is the link to their documentation page. BUT IF YOU DONT NEED ONE OF THESE, DO NOT VISIT THIS DOCUMENTATION! here is the link to the documentation for RN reusables: https://reactnativereusables.com/docs


## Data entry
the following is an example fo the format you should input into the data.md prd for the data that this screen requires. 

```json
{
  "$schema": "public",
  "title": "test_objects",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "Represents a job/task in the system",
  "properties": {
    "id": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "format": "uuid", 
      "purpose": "primary key", 
      "owner": "system",
      "description": "Unique identifier auto-generated by system"
    },
    "name": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 255,
      "purpose": "display name", 
      "owner": "product",
      "description": "User-friendly name shown in UI"
    },
    "status": { 
      "type": "string", 
      "enum": ["draft","active","done"], 
      "default": "draft",
      "description": "Current state of the job"
    }
  },
  "required": ["id","name","owner_user_id","status"],
  "rls_policies": {
    "select": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "insert": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "update": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()",
    "delete": "owner_user_id = auth.uid()"
  }
}
```

# Tools
for all research tools you should be very accurate with waht you are searching for so that it does not return to many tokens. you should optimize for low token count. 

## supabase mcp
you have access to the supabase mcp. you should use this tool to find any documentation that you need given that your research is very percise. do not reserach to much. you should optimize for low amount of tokens. 

## stripe mcp
You have access to the stripe mcp which you should only use to write products and stuff into stripe. you should not use this for documentation, you should use context 7 for documentation. 

## context 7
you have access to the context7 mcp which you should use for documentation reserach. 
Important: you seraches should be specific, you should not do many different general searches. you should search for specific things so that context7 returns a low amount of token. and yo ushould optimize for low token count. the following are just some of the things you can reserach on context7: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js, Remix, React Native, Expo, Flutter, Swift, SwiftUI, Kotlin, Node.js, Express, NestJS, FastAPI, Django, Rails, GraphQL, tRPC, Supabase, Firebase, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Drizzle ORM, TypeORM, shadcn/ui, Material-UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, TailwindCSS, styled-components, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, Recoil, MobX, Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, Testing Library, Vite, Webpack, Turbopack, esbuild, Stripe, Clerk, Auth0, NextAuth, Vercel, AWS SDK, Cloudflare Workers.

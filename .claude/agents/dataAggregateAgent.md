# You Are The Data Aggregate Agent

## Context
When this agent runs, that means that all screens have been coded, and the nexAgent which puts all the screens in the right lace and does some basic debuggign has ran. so the functional part of the app is close to finished. when these coding agents get done they enter all the data they need into the 2data.md in the prd's folder. But each of these coding agents run individually, so sometimes the data may not be exactly correct, or there might be small contradictions, and other errors. Your job will be to enter this 1data.md into supabase database. 

## YOUR JOB:
Your job is to do the following:
  - Read the 1overview.md in the prd's folder
  - Read the 2data.md in the prd's folder
  - extract all data entities / tables from the 2data.md
  - make sure there are no duplcates, if there are, you should merge them. 
  - ensure propper defaults, rls policies, PK's, and required and not required fields make sence and no contradictions with those. 
  - make sure all FK's and relationships are propperly mapped. 
  - make sure that the accounts table (if it exists) propperly references the users id in the imutable auth.users table. 
  - standardize naming, use all snake_case. 
  - if you are confused on how anything should go, you should explor the app and how the app works, its purpose, and decide for yourself based on your research. 
THEN, once you have done all that, you should use the supabse mcp to create the migrations in supabase. 

### 4. VALIDATE SCHEMA
- [ ] All tables have PKs, FKs, enums, required fields, defaults, RLS
- [ ] Naming consistent, no circular dependencies
- [ ] RLS on all tables, no direct auth.uid() checks against auth schema

### 5. PROVISION TO SUPABASE
Use Supabase MCP in dependency order:
1. main accounts and profile tables (most of the time will just be an 'accounts' table)
2. Tables (dependency order)
3. Junction tables (if there are any)
4. RLS policies
5. Indexes, functions, triggers

Log each operation. Retry on dependency failures.

### 6. TEST & VALIDATE
- Verify tables, RLS, policies, foreign keys exist
- Test insert/select operations
- Test RLS blocks/allows correctly
- Test cascade deletes and behaviors
- ensure test data fully cleaned

### Other considerations: 
  CONFLICT RESOLUTION
  - When duplicate tables found, merge using most restrictive constraints and required fields

  DATABASE OBJECTS
  - Create required functions: update_updated_at_column() for all tables with updated_at
  - Create triggers: account creation trigger on auth.users, updated_at triggers
  - Apply indexes, unique constraints, ON DELETE behaviors from schemas

  TYPE CONVERSION
  - Map JSON schema types to PostgreSQL (uuid→UUID, timestamptz→TIMESTAMPTZ, number→NUMERIC)

  RLS IMPLEMENTATION
  - Parse policy JSON into SQL policies
  - "Service role only" = no user policy
  - auth.uid() patterns = user isolation policies

  TEST REQUIREMENTS
  - Use multiple user contexts to verify RLS isolation
  - Test all cascade behaviors
  - Ensure test data fully cleaned

### Rules
  - do not create enumns in supabase, those will be handles on the front end, if there is an enum missing on the front end, you should code it on the front end and dont put it in supabase. 
  - auth.users is immutable, dont try to edit it, this is created by supabase and should not be added, eddited, or deleted. but you will most likey use the 'id' field from it for other tables. 
  - in the case of merges, renames, or any breaking change, you should find where it is in the app, and edit the app so that the data dosent break the app. 
  - if you are unsure about a piece of data and its rls policies, nullableness, FK's, defaults, etc, you should explor the app to see how the data is used and manipulated in the app so that you can find the right solution to your confusion. 
  - Cross-reference existing code before changes
  - Use public.users.id for FK references (not auth.users.id) - exept in the top most level accounts table where the users table has to reference the auth schema. 
  - Enable RLS on every public table
  - Use transactions for all-or-nothing provisioning

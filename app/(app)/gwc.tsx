          GWC (Get it, Want it, Capacity to do it) is a simple yet powerful framework from the Traction
          methodology for evaluating whether someone is right for a role. All three components must be
          present for someone to truly excel in their position.

            When someone "gets it," you don't need to explain things repeatedly. They intuitively

            You can't create "want it" - it either exists naturally or it doesn't. People who
            want their role bring positive energy that spreads to the entire team.

            Someone might get it and want it, but if they lack the capacity, they'll struggle
            and underperform. Capacity is about matching role demands with available resources.

            Use GWC when evaluating candidates for hiring, assessing current team members, or
            considering role changes. Ask yourself honestly: Does this person Get it? Want it?
            Have the Capacity to do it? If the answer to any is no, address that gap through
            coaching, repositioning, or finding someone who has all three. This simple framework
            prevents countless performance issues and helps everyone find their right seat.

<!-- UI/UX BIAS FOR FUTURE DESIGN PASS

Typography is the hero - use hierarchy, weight, spacing to create visual interest.
Generous whitespace, confident layout choices.

Consider pull quotes, visual separators, subtle accents to break up text.

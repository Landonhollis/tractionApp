# This is the screen bias directory

## what is a screen bias
Screen biases are not about how exactly do code something. They are a philosophy. screen biases are focused on the goal of a screen, not its funcitonality. screen biases are what a screen optimizes for. these optimizations that the screen baises try to accomplishmight be visuals, clarity, conversion to checkout, data visualisation, and more. these biases guide what should stand out, what should stay in the shadows, what buttons should be clicked, what is the main object, and how should the user feel when using this screen. 

## your job
You, the agent, will use this to figure out which screen biases you should use. you are allowed to use more than one because many screen biases will overlap, if the screen does not require any screen biases, you are allowed to not choose any. you should choose the ones that apply to the screen you are styling. All screen biases have an extended description and explination in (relitive path) "./screenBiasNameHere.md". Once you have decided, from this directory, which screen bias / biases you need, you should go to those files within this same folders and read about them. YOU SHOULD NOT EXPLOR OTHER SCREEN BIASES, ONLY THE ONES YOU HAVE DECIDED ON!!

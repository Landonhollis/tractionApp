# High Contrast

do not use this global bias unless high contrast was stated in the custom global bias. 

this global bias is less of an app purpose, but is a style to achieve. 

this app should be high contrasted in colors.

the edges should be sharper than normal. 

you should use text-strong instead of text normal from the themeCore. 

you should use less shadow. 

border colors should also be bc-strong instead of bc-normal.

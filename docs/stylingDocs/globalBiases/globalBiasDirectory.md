## what is a global bias
Global biases define the overarching design philosophy for entire app categories. They are not about specific features or screens, but about the fundamental goals and emotional tone the entire app should convey. Global biases shape priorities: what matters most in management apps differs from social apps or finance apps. These biases guide macro decisions about information density, visual weight, urgency, trust signals, and overall user mindset.

## your job
You, the agent, will use this to determine which global bias applies to the app being styled. Typically, one global bias will apply per app, though hybrid apps may combine two related biases. Choose the bias that best matches the app's primary purpose. All global biases have an extended description in (relative path) "./globalBiasNameHere.md". Once you have decided which global bias applies, read that file for guidance. YOU SHOULD NOT EXPLORE OTHER GLOBAL BIASES, ONLY THE ONE YOU HAVE DECIDED ON!!

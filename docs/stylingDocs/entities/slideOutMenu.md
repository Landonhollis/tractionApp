# this is the styling for menus

## sliding
menus shoudl slide out via drag out motion or a menu icon click. when the menu slides out there should be a smooth transition, it should not be a hard transition. to slide in, the user should click anywhere that is not the menu, or slide the menu in with their finger. 

## hiarchy

the hiarchy of menu items should be clear. the more important items, most of this time on the top, should be biger and bolder. then things that are less important thouls not be as big and bold. the catagories of the menu items should be clear, there should not be random boldened items and then random dimmer items. all items within a section should have the same style.

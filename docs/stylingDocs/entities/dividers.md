# Divider and Separator Styling Guide

## Divider Fundamentals

### Purpose
- Separate content into logical groups
- Create visual breathing room
- Establish hierarchy through spacing and weight
- Guide user's eye through content

### Visual Treatment
- Subtle—dividers support content, not dominate
- Consistent color (usually light gray or border color)
- Thickness typically 1px or hairline
- Avoid heavy, dark dividers unless intentional emphasis

## Divider Types

### Full-Width Dividers
- Span entire width of container
- Strong visual separation
- Used between major sections
- Can feel heavy if overused

### Inset Dividers
- Indented from one or both edges
- Softer separation than full-width
- Common in lists (inset from left to align with text)
- Reduces visual weight

### Spacer Dividers
- No visible line—just white space
- Subtle separation for related content
- Cleanest look
- Relies on adequate spacing to group content

### Decorative Dividers
- Thicker or styled lines
- Icons or text within divider
- Used sparingly for emphasis
- Can include gradient or color

## Usage Patterns

### List Item Separation
- Inset dividers between list items
- No divider after last item
- Consider using gap instead of dividers for cleaner look
- Full-width dividers for category changes

### Section Separation
- Dividers between major screen sections
- Often paired with spacing and section headers
- Heavier dividers for stronger breaks
- Consistent treatment throughout screen

### Content Grouping
- Dividers within cards or containers
- Separate related info into subsections
- Lighter weight than screen-level dividers
- Consider if spacing alone suffices

## Spacing

### Divider Proximity
- Equal spacing above and below divider (usually)
- More space around dividers = softer separation
- Less space = tighter grouping
- Consistent spacing throughout app

### Spacing vs Dividers
- Often spacing alone is sufficient
- Dividers add visual weight—use when needed
- Cleaner designs use fewer dividers
- Test if divider is necessary or just habit

## Visual Weight

### Subtle Dividers
- Hairline or 1px
- Light gray or low opacity
- Gentle separation
- Most common throughout app

### Emphasized Dividers
- Thicker (2-3px)
- Darker or colored
- Strong visual break
- Used sparingly for major sections

## Common Issues

### Overuse
- Dividers everywhere creates visual clutter
- Spacing alone often sufficient
- Too many lines competes with content

### Inconsistent Treatment
- Mixing full-width and inset without reason
- Varying thickness or color
- Unclear hierarchy

### Too Heavy
- Dark, thick dividers dominate content
- Creates choppy, fragmented feel
- Reduces visual flow

### Poor Spacing
- Dividers too close to content
- Unequal spacing above/below
- Dividers touching edges when inset intended

### Wrong Context
- Dividers within buttons or small components
- Dividing unrelated content (confuses grouping)
- Using dividers where spacing better serves

### Accessibility Issues
- Dividers without semantic meaning for screen readers
- Over-reliance on visual dividers for structure
- Decorative dividers interfere with content flow

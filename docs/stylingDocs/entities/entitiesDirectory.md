## what is an entitiy
One entity is one 'thing' or 'object' or 'system' in a screen. these can be cards, menus, buttons, lists, responsive layouts, and more. 

## your job
You, the agent, will use this to figure out which entities you should look up the documentation for. if no entities from the given choices are needed, you are allowd to not choose any. All entities have an extended description and explination in (relitive path) "./entityNameHere.md". Once you have decided, from this directory, which entities you need, you should go to those files within this same folders and read about them. YOU SHOULD NOT EXPLOR OTHER entites, ONLY THE ONES YOU HAVE DECIDED ON!!

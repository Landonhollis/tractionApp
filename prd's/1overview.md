## Global UI design bias - ONLY FOR STYLING AGENTS!!
[ ]: presentational - visually rich with fancy fonts, large graphics, and generous whitespace. 
[x]: businesness management - function first, graphs are less visual, more numeric. display is more plain, but more clear. 
[ ]: shop - conversion first = clear checkout flow, smooth transitions, bold CTA's, high contrast palate. 
[x]: custom: emphasis on well defined sections, very distinctivley seperated. this is because of the amount of business information that needs to be easily scrolled through. 

- custom global styles examples (just a reminder for humans): text size, font selection, color placement, contrast, statefull creativity, component design specifications, minimalism level, level of 3-d'ness, polish specifications.

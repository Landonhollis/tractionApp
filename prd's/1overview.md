## Global UI design bias - ONLY FOR STYLING AGENTS!!
[ ]: presentational - visually rich with fancy fonts, large graphics, and generous whitespace. 
[ ]: businesness management - function first, graphs are less visual, more numeric. display is more plain, but more clear. 
[ ]: shop - conversion first = clear checkout flow, smooth transitions, bold CTA's, high contrast palate.
